	    		<p class="tictactoe" align="justify"><b>Tic Tac Toe</b> is a paper and pencil game for two players, representing X and O. They
	    		take turns marking the 3 by 3 grid, and whoever marks three of their symbols in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
	    		The bot uses the minimax algorithm to figure out the best move to make. It is a recursive algorithm, which chooses the optimal move while also assuming the opponent also will make an optimal move. One player is the maximizer (tries to maximize the score), and the other is the minimizer. For example, a win for X would be considered the max score, so the algorithm would try to achieve the max score.
	    		Since Tic Tac Toe has a relatively small board, the number of possible game moves is only 5478 (see math.stackexchange user MJD's calculations <a href="https://gist.github.com/mjdominus/6465846">here</a>). For a much more complex game such as Chess or Go, a more efficient method like alpha-beta pruning would be used to optimize the search times. This project was coded in <b>Java</b>.

				<p class="tictactoe" align="justify"><b>Gomoku</b>, or Five in a Row, is a board game played with Go pieces. Similar to Tic Tac Toe, players alternate in placing a stone on an empty spot, and the first player to reach five stones in a row wins.

				However, Gomoku is drastically more complex than other similarly styled m,n,k-games, with a game-tree complexity of 10<sup>70</sup> possible game states. This makes the minimax algorithm for the AI component much slower to compute, as there is now a maximum of 15*15 moves possible taken by a player on each move, as opposed to 9 for Tic Tac Toe. With this in mind, and also the fact that the algorithm has to search several moves ahead in time, the computational time required makes it impossible to solve the game, at least in this scale. To optimize the search times, the most popular pruning method, alpha-beta pruning, was used. In addition, only moves that are adjacent to the current game shape are considered, meaning moves that are far away from any other pieces are omitted.
				<br><br>

				Fortunately, Gomoku is solved, meaning that there is a winning strategy such that if played perfectly, the first player (black) will always win. You can take a look at the article <a href="allis1994.pdf">here</a>. This project was coded in <b>Java</b> and the sprites created in <b>Photoshop</b>.
