        <p><b>Ant Simulation</b> is inspired by a project made by Sebastian Lague.
            <br><br>
            The simulation follows several heuristics:

        <ul>
            <li>Ants spawn out of the colony (brown) and aim to find food to bring back to the colony (green).</li>
            <li>Ants randomly explore the area. If they hit the border, they will bounce back immediately.</li>
            <li>While exploring, ants secrete a pheromone a pheromone (blue) that helps guide them home if they have
                found food. In real life, they use other methods in addition, such as the sun or certain landmarks on
                the ground.</li>
            <li>If they find food, they secrete a different pheromone to let other ants know of their path (red), and
                try to find their way home.</li>
            <li>Pheromones evaporate over time.</li>
            <li>While other ants do not have food (exploring), they will try to follow red pheromones because it is more
                likely to find food if they follow this trail than to randomly explore.</li>
        </ul>

        Over time, this lets the ant colony generate the shortest path to a food source. Because pheromones evaporate
        over time, less optimal paths will be walked on less, and ants will gravitate towards paths that are more
        travelled. Iteratively, this produces the optimal path.

        <br><br>
        If many food sources are present, this is an abstraction of a local search algorithm to solve the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problem</a>, where the
        colony is the origin node, and the food source is all the nodes that have to be visitied.

        <br><br>
