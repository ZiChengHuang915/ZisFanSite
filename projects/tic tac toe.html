        <p><b>Tic Tac Toe</b> is a paper and pencil game for two players, representing X and O. They take turns marking the 3 by 3 grid, and whoever marks three of their symbols in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The bot uses
            the minimax algorithm to figure out the best move to make. It is a recursive algorithm, which chooses the optimal move while also assuming the opponent also will make an optimal move. One player is the maximizer (tries to maximize the score),
            and the other is the minimizer. For example, a win for X would be considered the max score, so the algorithm would try to achieve the max score. Since Tic Tac Toe has a relatively small board, the number of possible game moves is only 5478
            (see math.stackexchange user MJD's calculations <a href="https://gist.github.com/mjdominus/6465846">here</a>). For a much more complex game such as Chess or Go, a more efficient method like alpha-beta pruning would be used to optimize the
            search times. This project was coded in <b>Java</b>.
