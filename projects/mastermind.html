        <p><b>Mastermind</b>, according to Wikipedia, is a code-breaking game for two players. The game is playing using a decoding board, eight colors, and a code length of adjustable size (by default it is 4). One player creates a code, and the other player
            tries to guess the code in an alotted number of tries, usually 12. After each try, the first player gives hints based on the code that the second player has just guessed. The blue circles represent the number of correct colors in the wrong
            position, and the red circles represent the number of correct colors in the right position. Based on this input, player two suppoedly makes a better guess each time.
            <br><br> The graphics, especially the circle making, was sourced from this text: <a href="../sources/pixel graphics.pdf">Pixel Graphics</a>. This project was coded in <b>Turing</b>.
