        <p><b>Mastermind</b>, according to Wikipedia, is a code-breaking game for two players. The game is played using a decoding board, eight colors, and an adjustable code length (4 by default). One player creates a code, and the other tries to guess
            the code in an alotted number of tries, usually 12. After each try, the first player gives hints based on the code that the second player has just guessed. The blue circles represent the number of correct colors in the wrong position, and
            the red circles represent the number of correct colors in the right position. Based on this input, player two supposedly makes a better guess each time.
            <br><br> The graphics, especially the circle making, was sourced from this text: <a href="../sources/pixel graphics.pdf">Pixel Graphics</a>. This project was coded in <b>Turing</b>.
