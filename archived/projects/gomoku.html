        <p><b>Gomoku</b>, or Five in a Row, is a board game played with Go pieces. Similar to Tic Tac Toe, players
            alternate in placing a stone on an empty spot, and the first player to reach five stones in a row wins.
            However, Gomoku is drastically more
            complex than other similarly styled m,n,k-games, with a game-tree complexity of 10<sup>70</sup> possible
            game states. This makes the minimax algorithm for the AI component much slower to compute, as there is now a
            maximum of 15*15 moves possible
            taken by a player on each move, as opposed to 9 for Tic Tac Toe. With this in mind, and also the fact that
            the algorithm has to search several moves ahead in time, the computational time required makes it impossible
            to solve the game, at least
            in this scale. To optimize the search times, the most popular pruning method, alpha-beta pruning, was used.
            In addition, only moves that are adjacent to the current game shape are considered, meaning moves that are
            far away from any other
            pieces are omitted.<br><br> Fortunately, Gomoku is solved, meaning that there is a winning strategy such
            that if played perfectly, the first player (black) will always win. You can take a look at the article <a
                href="../sources/allis1994.pdf">here</a>.
